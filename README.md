# Devastation

- This group project will teach engineering
project management. Through the project, we will experience the
full lifecycle of a project, from requirements analysis through design and
implementation to closing the project.

- The project is a multiplayer web-based game aimed at teaching core software engineering concepts

## What we learned
- **Kanban Principles in Practice:** Developed a deeper understanding of Agile methodologies, particularly Kanban, including workflow visualization, limiting WIP, managing flow, and fostering team collaboration.
- **Gamification for Education:** Explored the potential of gamified learning to simplify complex topics and improve user engagement, creating an interactive multiplayer game to teach first-year engineering students.
- **Iterative Development:** Learned the value of prototyping and iterative refinement, transitioning from free movement to grid-based mechanics for better user experience and gameplay consistency.
- **Architectural Decision-Making:** Gained insights into selecting appropriate architectural models (client-server) and communication protocols (WebSockets and HTTP hybrid) to balance scalability, performance, and real-time responsiveness.
- **Modularity and Maintainability:** Improved client-side architecture by adopting a modular approach for state management and separating rendering, input handling, and communication tasks.
- **User-Centric Design:** Identified the importance of intuitive UI and clear instructions, recognizing areas for improvement based on user feedback, such as distinguishing game elements and simplifying navigation.

## Objective

- Our project aims to develop a fun and educational web-based multiplayer game, called Dev-A-Station, designed to teach agile software development principles through interactive gameplay.
- Dev-A-Station simulates a software development environment using a top-down Kanban board map where players assume distinct roles such as Project Manager, Developer, and Tester. 
- Players navigate through interconnected rooms, completing tasks while managing workload and avoiding burnout. 
- The game incorporates real-world agile challenges like random events and prioritising tasks.
